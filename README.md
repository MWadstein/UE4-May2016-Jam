# UE4-May2016-Jam
Project files for the May 2016 Unreal Engine 4 Game Jam - A Bad Day

The source code is *not* commented very well if at all and with this being a Game Jam I just hacked stuff together to make it work. 1 use Actors all over the place, Fixed variables,  using the Level Blueprint!  All of that horror exists in this project =)
